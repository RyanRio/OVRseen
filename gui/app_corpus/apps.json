With 6 fully original and highly differentiated levels, where each one feels like an entire new game, Pixel Ripped 1995 is an incredible journey for both VR and retro gamers.", "App_Title": "Pixel Ripped 1995", "Average_Rating": "4.666666667", "Category": "Games", "Developer": "ARVORE Immersive Experiences", "Developer_Privacy_Policy": "https://arvore.io/privacy-policy/", "Developer_Terms_of_Service": "https://arvore.io/terms-of-service/", "Game_Modes": "Single User", "Genres": "Action, Adventure, Arcade", "Languages": "English, English (US), French (France), German, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese (Brazil), Spanish (Mexico)", "Price": "19.99", "Publisher": "ARVORE Immersive Experiences", "Purchase_Section": "$19.99Buy for a friendRedeem giftAdd to WishlistShareOffers In-App PurchasesComfortableSupports QuestSupports Oculus TouchInternet connection not requiredOculus Refund Policy", "Rating_Count": "760", "Release_Date": "23-Apr-20", "Reviews_Stats": "5 stars\n84%\n4 stars\n10%\n3 stars\n3%\n2 stars\n1%\n1 star\n2%", "Space_Required": "1.53 GB", "Supported_Controllers": "Oculus Touch", "Supported_Platforms": "Quest", "Supported_Player_Modes": "Sitting", "Version": "", "Version_Release_Notes": "107", "Website": "http://www.pixelripped.com/"}, {"App_Description": "Please, Dont Touch Anything is a cryptic, brain-racking button-pushing puzzle game. \n\nCovering for a colleague taking a bathroom break, you find yourself in front of a mysterious console with a green screen monitor showing a pixelated live image of an unknown city.
